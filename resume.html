<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
  I have an interest in mathematical formalization and its implementation on computers.
</p>

<p>
  My motivation of research has been formalization of reasoning.<br/>
  That is, my aim is to propose a mathematical definition of reasoning and implement it.<br/>
  Thinking so, I majored computer science and learned especially mathematical logic and programming in the university.
</p>
  
<p>
  In that process, I got interest in the design and implementation of programming languages.<br/>
  Pursuit of direct representation of computer programs suited me very much.<br/>
  Then, I got an idea of the mechanism to strengthen the expressive power of pattern-matching expressions and implemented it in my new programming language Egison.<br/>
  For detail on Egison, please see <a href="https://www.egison.org">the website</a> and <a href="https://www.egison.org/blog/RTC2015.html">my latest presentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Recently, I have interest in importing ideas of mathematics behind machine learning technology into programming languages.<br/>
  There are still several notations and modularization that are possible on papers but impossible on computer programs.<br/>
  My research purpose is to fill these gaps and accelerate research of science.

<h3>The Egison Programming Language (Ongoing)</h3>
<p><u><a href="https://www.egison.org">https://www.egison.org</a></u><br></p>

<p>
  I have designed and implemented programming language Egison.
  Egison is a programming language whose feature is non-linear pattern-matching with backtracking.
  We can directly represent pattern-matching against lists, multisets, sets, trees, graphs and any kind of data types.
</p>

<p>
  Egison proposes a new paradigm <strong>pattern-matching-oriented</strong>.
  The combination of <strong>all of the following features</strong> enables intuitive powerful pattern-matching.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Modularization of the way of pattern-matching</li>
  <li>Pattern-matching with backtracking</li>
  <li>Non-linear patterns with lexical scoping</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Egison is implemented in Haskell and distributed as a hackage package.
  Egison is getting popular and attracting a lot of people.
</p>

<h3>Scheme Compiler (Past work)</h3>
<p><u><a href="https://github.com/egisatoshi/scheme-compiler">https://github.com/egisatoshi/scheme-compiler</a></u><br>
  I have an experience writing a Scheme compiler.
  This compiler generates optimized machine language code which I designed.
  This source contains the compiler, assembler, and simulator.
  The assembler generates a byte code from a file generated by the compiler.
  A byte code generated by the assembler can be executed by the simulator.
  I wrote the compiler and assembler in Scheme.
  Simulator is written in C.
  The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/egisatoshi/scheme-compiler">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h3>Scheme Meta-Circular Interpreter (Past work)</h3>
<p>
  I have implemented a meta-circular interpreter of Scheme.
  A meta-circular interpreter can recuresively execute itself.
  I have implemented it in 10 days after touching Scheme and functional programming for the first time in my life.
