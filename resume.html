  I studied on intuitive expression of algorithms.
  As a result, I have designed and implemented the programming language Egison, whose feature is strong pattern-matching facility.
  I will introduce Egison detail in Activity section below.

<h3>The Egison Programming Language</h3>
<p><u>http://www.egison.org</u><br></p>

<p>
  I have designed and implemented programming language Egison.
  Egison is the world's first programming language that realized non-linear pattern-matching with backtracking.
  We can directly represent pattern-matching against lists, multisets, sets, trees, graphs and any kind of data types.
</p>

<p>
  Egison proposes a new paradigm <strong>pattern-matching-oriented</strong>.
  The combination of <strong>all of the following features</strong> enables intuitive powerful pattern-matching.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Modularization of the way of pattern-matching</li>
  <li>Pattern-matching with backtracking</li>
  <li>Non-linear patterns with lexical scoping</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Egison is implemented in Haskell and distributed as a hackage package.
  Egison is getting popular and attracting a lot of people.

  The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/egison/egison">GitHub</a>.

<h3>Scheme Compiler</h3>
<p><u>https://github.com/egisatoshi/scheme-compiler</u><br>
  I have an experience writing a Scheme compiler.
  This compiler generates optimized machine language codes which I designed.
  This source contains the compiler, assembler, and simulator.
  The assembler generates a byte code from a file generated by the compiler.
  A byte code generated by the assembler can be executed by the simulator.
  I wrote the compiler and assembler with Scheme.
  Simulator is written in C for speed.
  The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/egisatoshi/scheme-compiler">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h3>Gohantabeyo.com</h3>
<p><u>http://gohantabeyo.com</u><br>
  I am the second administrator of <a href="http://gohantabeyo.com">gohantabeyo.com</a> website.
  We can find someone who want to have lunch with each other using this site.
  This site is a twitter application build using Ruby on Rails.
</p>

<h3>Tomotomotter</h3>
<p>
  Tomotomotter is a kinds of bottle mail application based on twitter.
  With this application, we can exchange letters with our friends of friends, without knowing who they are each other.
  We regard two people have friendships if they are following each other.
  We can increase our friends with this application.
  This site is now closed.
</p>

<h3>egsh</h3>
<p><u>https://github.com/egisatoshi/egsh</u><br>
  I have an experience writing a simple shell which run on UNIX in C.
  The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/egisatoshi/egsh">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h3>Simple HTTP Server</h3>
<p>
  I have an experience writing a simple HTTP server which run on UNIX in C.
