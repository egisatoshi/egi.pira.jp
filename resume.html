<h3>Programming Language Egison</h3>
<p><u>http://www.egison.org</u><br></p>

<p>
  I have designed and implemented programming language Egison.
  The feature of Egison is expressive power of pattern-matching with <i>unfree data types</i>, such as sets and multisets, whose data have no canonical form.
</p>

<p>
  In pattern-matching of well-known programming languages, the existence of canonical forms is assumed.
  Therefore, when we do pattern-matching with unfree data types, we need to translate and regard them as data which have a canonical form.
  For example, a set would be treated as a list.
  Many programmers think this is unavoidable, and in fact, it is a latent stress of programming.
  Sets and multisets often play important roles in expressing algorithms.
  So natural expression for handling these kinds of data is also important.
</p>

<p>
  Egison is the world's first programming language that makes pattern-matching with unfree data types practical.
  Following features enables pattern-matching with unfree data types.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Multiple pattern-matching results</dt>
  <dd>
    Pattern-matching has multiple results.
    This feature is necessary to pattern-match with unfree data types.
    Because unfree data have many forms for same data, so there are multiple ways of destruction.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Non-linear patterns</dt>
  <dd>
    Bindings in a pattern can be refer in the same pattern.
    It is necessary to write useful patterns for pattern-matching with multiple results.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Patterns have lexical scoping</dt>
  <dd>
    We can modularize useful patterns with <i>pattern-function</i>, functions that receive patterns and return a pattern.
    Since a pattern-function has lexical scoping, bindings for pattern-variables in the argument patterns and the body of pattern-functions don't conflict.
    Useful patterns can be reused in many places in a program without worry of name clash.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  There are other projects following Egison.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/xenophobia/Egison-Quote">Egison-Quote</a> is one of those.
  This project is started by a participant of Egison Workshop really attracted by Egison.
  Egison-Quote enable to use Egison expression in Haskell programs.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/alpicola/vim-egison">vim-egison</a> is another one of those.
  The developer of vim-egison has joined Egison team after she developed it.
  Vim-egison helps us to write Egison programs with vim.
</p>

<p>
  Egison is implemented in Haskell and distributed as a hackage package.
  Egison is getting popular and attracting a lot of people.
  Now, Egison developing team has 10 members.
</p>

  Here is the manual of Egison version 3.

<h3>Scheme Compiler</h3>
<p><u>https://github.com/egisatoshi/scheme-compiler</u><br>
  I have an experience writing a Scheme compiler.
  This compiler generates optimized machine language codes which I designed.
  This source contains the compiler, assembler, and simulator.
  The assembler generates a byte code from a file generated by the compiler.
  A byte code generated by the assembler can be executed by the simulator.
  I wrote the compiler and assembler with Scheme.
  Simulator is written in C for speed.
  The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/egisatoshi/scheme-compiler">github page</a>.

<h3>Gohantabeyo.com</h3>
<p><u>http://gohantabeyo.com</u><br>
  I am the second administrator of <a href="http://gohantabeyo.com">gohantabeyo.com</a> web site.
  This site has around 85,000 active users now.
  We can find someone who want to have lunch with each other using this site.
  This site is a twitter application build using Ruby on Rails.
</p>

<h3>Tomotomotter</h3>
<p><u>https://github.com/egisatoshi/tomotomotter</u><br>
  Tomotomotter is a kinds of bottle mail application based on twitter.
  With this application, we can exchange letters with our friends of friends, without knowing who they are each other.
  We regard two people have friendships if they are following each other.
  We can increase our friends with this application.
  This site is now closed.
  The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/egisatoshi/tomotomotter">github page</a>.

<h3>egsh</h3>
<p><u>https://github.com/egisatoshi/egsh</u><br>
  I have an experience writing a simple shell which run on UNIX in C.
  The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/egisatoshi/egsh">github page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Simple HTTP Server</h3>
<p>
  I have an experience writing a simple HTTP server which run on UNIX in C.
